# Wavelet Transforms

## Supported Transform Types

### Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
- Standard wavelet decomposition for signal and image processing
- Decomposes signals into different frequency components at discrete scales
- Key Features:
  - Time-frequency localization
  - Multi-resolution analysis
  - Computational efficiency
- Common Applications:
  - Signal compression (e.g., JPEG 2000)
  - Signal denoising
  - Feature extraction in machine learning
- Decomposition Process:
  - Breaks down 2D images into:
    - Low-frequency (LL)
    - Horizontal high-frequency (HL)
    - Vertical high-frequency (LH)
    - Diagonal high-frequency (HH) components
- Typical Wavelet Families:
  - Daubechies (most common)
  - Coiflet
  - Symlet

### Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT)
- Translation-invariant wavelet transform
- Maintains original signal sampling rate
- Key Characteristics:
  - No downsampling between levels
  - Redundant representation preserving signal details
  - Overcomes translation sensitivity of DWT
- Primary Applications:
  - Image Denoising
  - Edge Detection
  - Image Enhancement
  - Medical Image Processing
- Unique Technical Approach:
  - Uses 'Ã  trous' (with holes) algorithm
  - Inserts zeros in filters to maintain resolution
  - Generates consistent length sequences across levels
- Advantages:
  - Improved feature preservation
  - Better noise reduction
  - Enhanced edge and texture analysis

### Quaternion Wavelet Transform (QWT)
- Advanced mathematical transform based on quaternion algebra
- Theoretical Foundation:
  - Generalizes real and complex wavelet transforms
  - Uses four-dimensional signal representation
  - Based on quaternion Fourier transform theory
- Key Capabilities:
  - Approximate shift-invariance
  - Rich phase information representation
  - Detailed multi-resolution signal analysis
- Advanced Applications:
  - Signal processing
  - Image denoising
  - Feature extraction
  - Complex signal representation
- Technical Advantages:
  - Overcomes phase ambiguity in signal representations
  - Provides multi-dimensional signal decomposition
  - Reduces energy distribution changes from signal shifts
- Research Focus:
  - Generalized signal processing mathematics
  - Advanced signal representation techniques
  - Improved time-frequency localization
