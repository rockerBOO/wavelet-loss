# PyWavelets Integration

## Overview
PyWavelets is a key Python library for wavelet transforms, providing high-performance wavelet analysis tools.

## Library Features
- Supports 1D and 2D wavelet transforms
- Multiple wavelet decomposition methods:
  - Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
  - Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT)
  - Wavelet Packet Decomposition

## Wavelet Families
PyWavelets includes 14 built-in wavelet families:
- Daubechies (db1-db38)
- Coiflets
- Symlets
- Other specialized wavelets

## Example Usage
```python
import pywt

# Perform 1D Discrete Wavelet Transform
coeffs = pywt.dwt([1, 2, 3, 4], 'db4')

# Perform 2D Wavelet Transform
coeffs_2d = pywt.dwt2([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 'db4')
```

## Performance Characteristics
- Written in C and Cython for high performance
- Low-level interface with NumPy integration
- Supports multiple Python versions (>=3.10)

## Why Use PyWavelets?
- Comprehensive wavelet analysis toolkit
- Efficient signal processing
- Easy-to-use Python interface
- Broad scientific computing applications
